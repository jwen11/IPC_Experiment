1. How to make
    a)On normal PC, just do 
        $make
    b)On P4080, do
        $make P4080=true

2. What you can modify in include/define.h
    MEASURE_PRODUCER 0: measure consumer
                     1: measure producer
    ITER (NUM) : NUM iterations
    PERIOD (num): the period of the periodic tasks are num us                     

3.How to run the experiments on P4080
login with jwen11
sudo ./init_locker.sh
modify the testset of "run_testset.sh"
cd SCE/IPC_Experiment/run_testset.sh


4.Use ./log/util/collect.sh to collect data from the log
  a. cd ./log/util
  b. ./collect.sh

5. Use for.sh for trace
    ITER has been changed to 1, data size and iteration are all specified in for.sh

6. Use read_trace.py to process trace result
    useage: python read_trace.py filename
